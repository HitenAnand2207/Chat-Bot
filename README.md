# Project 2

This is a small Python web app that renders a template from the `templates` folder. It is set up as a simple starting point you can extend with routes, forms, and data handling.

## What is here
- `app.py` runs the web app.
- `templates/` holds the HTML templates.

## Quick start
1) Create and activate a virtual environment.
2) Install dependencies if you have a `requirements.txt` file.
3) Set the `GROQ_API_KEY` environment variable (you can use a `.env` file for local development).
4) Run the app.

```bash
python app.py
```

## Notes
- If you add file uploads or a database, keep local data out of git.
- Update this README as the project grows.
